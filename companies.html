                        <strong>Companies Profile</strong>
                        <p>Apple Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related personal computing and mobile communication devices along with a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. Apple sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, third-party wholesalers, and resellers.</p>
                        <strong>Overview</strong>
                        <p>Ask Siri to name the most successful company in the world and it might respond: Apple. And it's not just out of familial pride. In terms of profit, revenue, market capitalization, and consumer cachet, it certainly ranks right up there. The iPhone, in its 10th year and eighth and ninth generations, has been the company's golden goose, generating tens of billions in revenue and profit. In addition to the iPhone, other familiar Apple products and services include Mac computers and iPad tablets, as well as iTunes, the App store, and Apple Music. Primarily a consumer-oriented company, Apple has inked several alliances with Accenture, General Electric, and IBM to deepen its penetration of the enterprise market. About 60% of revenue comes from outside the Americas.</p>
                        <strong>Operations</strong>
                        <p>Apple's iPhone, accounts for more than 60% of sales, while its other hardware products, the iPad line and the Mac desktop and portable computers, account for about 10% each. Services, which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay mobile payment, is the second biggest revenue producer, supplying about 15% of revenue. Products grouped under the Other segments make up the remaining sales.</p>
                        <p>Apple's hardware products are tightly integrated with the company’s software. The company’s operating systems are iOS for mobile devices, MacOS for computers, Apple WatchOS for the watch, and tvOS for Apple TV. The company generally releases generational updates of its operating systems once a year.</p>
                        <p>The company makes some of its products at facilities in Ireland and the US, but most manufacturing is handled by third party contractors, such as Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as FoxConn, operating in Asia.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Geographic Reach</strong>
                        <p>Apple generates 40% of sales in the Americas market, which includes the US, while Greater China and Europe each contribute about a quarter of revenue.</p>
                        <p>The company has nearly 500 Apple retail stores across the US, as well as in some 20 other countries; China and Canada are the largest retail store markets outside the US.</p>
                        <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>
                        <p>Apple sells its products through its own retail stores and website, as well as through a direct sales force. In addition, the company distributes through indirect channels, such as third-party retailers, resellers, and cellular network carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. Indirect channels account for about 70% of Apple's revenue.</p>

                    <p>Abbott Laboratories discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells a broad and diversified line of health care products and services. The Company's products include pharmaceuticals, nutritional, diagnostics, and vascular products. Abbott markets its products worldwide through affiliates and distributors.
                    </p>
                    <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
                    <p>With activities ranging from filling baby bottles to making generic medications, Abbott Laboratories is a top health care products manufacturer. Its nutritional products division makes such well-known brands as Similac infant formula and the Ensure line of nutrition supplements, while its drug division sells branded generic medicines (such as antibiotics and gastroenterology medicines) in international markets. The company also makes diagnostic instruments (including tests and assays), vascular medical devices such as its Xience drug-eluting stents, and the FreeStyle diabetes care line, as well as eye care products. The company acquired medical device maker St. Jude Medical for $23.6 billion in early 2017. Operations
                    </p>
                    <p>Abbott operates in five segments: Nutritional Products (the largest, accounting for some 35% of sales), which makes adult and pediatric nutritional items; Diagnostic (nearly 25% of sales), which makes tests, diagnostic products, and data management systems for labs; Established Pharmaceutical Products (nearly 20%), the branded generics arm; Vascular (about 15%), which makes devices for coronary, endovascular, and structural heart procedures; and Other (some 10%), which includes Abbott's Diabetes Care operations.</p>
                    <strong>Geographic Reach</strong>
                    <p>Abbott has plants in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, China, Canada, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Puerto Rico, Russia, Spain, Singapore, Sweden, the UK, and the US.</p>
                    <p>The company's products are sold in more than 150 countries. Abbott earns more than 30% of its revenues in the domestic market, some 50% in emerging markets (especially Brazil, China, India, and Russia), and around 20% in non-US developed markets (including Canada, Western Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia).</p>
                    <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>
                    <p>Abbott conducts distribution operations both from its own distribution centers and through third- party partners. Established pharmaceutical and nutritional customers include health care organizations, wholesalers, pharmacies, retailers, government agencies, and third-party distribution entities. Diagnostic and vascular products are sold to blood banks, hospitals and other health care facilities, physicians, plasma protein therapeutic companies, government agencies, alternative testing sites, and commercial laboratories.</p>

Diagnostic and vascular products are sold to blood banks, hospitals and other health care facilities, physicians, plasma protein therapeutic companies, government agencies, alternative testing sites, and commercial laboratories.</p>
                    <strong>Financial Performance</strong>
                    <p>Abbott's revenues declined significantly in 2013 as a result of the spinoff of AbbVie and the loss of that unit's income. It has held steady since then and, in 2016, it rose 2% to $20.9 billion. This was driven by modest increases in the Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, and Vascular segments but offset by a decline in the Nutritionals segment.</p>
                    <p>Net income had been in alignment with revenue but nearly doubled in 2015 when the company sold its non-US developed markets specialty and branded generics pharmaceuticals business and its animals business. In 2016 net income dropped 68% to $1.4 billion. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates, plus a steep reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations drove that decline. Despite that drop in net income, Abbott's cash flow from operations rose 8% to $3.2 billion in 2016. Leading factors contributing to that increase included the impact of currency devaluation and an adjustment in an investment in Mylan.</p>
                    <strong>Strategy</strong>
                    <p>Abbott has a diverse set of operations and it has lined up strategies specific to its different segments. In the Nutritionals segment, the company is focused on R&D activities in the pediatric, adult, and performance nutrition fields. It has a number of products in development which it expects to launch over the next few years.</p>
                    <p>The Diagnostic segment is focused on commercializing its blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry, and hematology systems, as well as various assays and management solutions. It also has molecular in vitro diagnostic products and systems under development. To boost its point-of-care diagnostics offerings, Abbott acquired Alere for $5.8 billion in 2017. Alere makes tests for cancers, cardiovascular disease, and infections such as HIV and malaria, among others.</p>
                    <p>In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, Abbott is working to build portfolios of branded generic medicines for emerging markets. It focuses on building country-specific portfolios to best meet the needs of each nation. The company has more than 400 projects under development. Among its key brands are Creon, Duphaston, and Influvac.</p>
                    <p>The Vascular segment has several projects in its pipeline, ranging from its MitraClip device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation and its Portico transcatheter heart valve and delivery system to its Supera self-expanding nitinol stent system and next-generation Xience products.</p>
                    <p>In 2015 Abbott sold its non-US developed markets specialty and branded generics operations to Mylan. The sale included a portfolio of more than 100 pharmaceutical products in markets including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand; upon closing of the deal, Abbott received a 21% stake in the combined company. The company also sold its animal health business to Zoetis in early 2015. Furthering its focus on cardiovascular and diagnostic operations, Abbott sold its Abbott Medical Optics subsidiary to Johnson & Johnson for $4.3 billion in early 2017.

                        <p>Northern Trust Corporation is a financial holding company that provides investment management, asset and fund administration, fiduciary, and banking solutions for corporations, institutions, and affluent individuals. Northern Trust banking operations are its primary operations.</p>
                        <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
                        <p>Individuals and institutions put their confidence in the Northern Trust Corporation. Through its flagship subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company, the corporation provides banking and trust services, brokerage, asset servicing, securities lending, and proprietary mutual funds (the Northern Funds). The firm offers its services to institutional clients and affluent individuals through more than 90 offices in nearly 20 states and more than 20 countries. Operating two main segments ? Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management ? Northern Trust has nearly 10 trillion in assets under custody/administration and $1.1 trillion under direct management.</p>
                        <strong>Operations</strong>
                        <p>The firm operates through two segments: Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. A third business unit, Asset Management, provides asset management and related services to its other segments.</p>
                        <p>The C&IS segment provides asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors. Its offerings include fund administration, investment operations outsourcing, investment management, risk and analytical services, employee benefit services, securities lending, foreign exchange, brokerage services, and banking. Assets under management are roughly $700 billion and assets under custody exceed $6.0 trillion. The segment accounts for about 55% of total revenue.</p>
                        <p>The Wealth Management business focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, and the like. It provides services such as investment management, philanthropic services, trust management, financial consulting, guardianship, brokerage services, and private & business banking. This segment has some $250 billion in assets under management and $550 billion in assets under custody. This business generates roughly 40% of revenue.</p>
                        <strong>Geographic Reach</strong>
                        <p>Based in Chicago, Northern Trust has a presence in 20 US states and more than 20 countries. About 80% of the company?s assets and revenues originate in the US.</p>
                        <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>
                        <p>The firm serves corporations, institutions (foundations, endowments, sovereign wealth funds), andaffluent families and individuals. Relationship management, and personalized service, are keys to maintaining, and growing, its client base.</p>
                        <strong>Financial Performance</strong>
                        <p>Following the Financial Crisis of 2008/2009, Northern Trust saw steep declines in both revenue and net income. Since 2011, however, it has stabilized financial performance and experienced steady, consistent growth in both metrics. Revenue grew from $3.9 billion to over $5.0 billion. Net income improved from $570 million to exceeding$1.0 for the first time in 2016.</p>
                        <p>The 2016 revenue result ticked up 5% from the prior year to $5.1 billion. Trust fees, the company's largest source of revenue, grew 4% and net interest income exceeded 15%growth, helped in no small part to a rise in US interest rates.</p>
                        <p>Net income for the year rose 6% to $1.0 billion, the highest amount in over a decade. Expenses -operating and income ? stayed in line with the previous year, enabling Norther Trust to flow the bump in revenue to its bottom line.</p>
                        <p>Cash on hand at the end of 2016 was $5.3 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from 2015. Operating activities provided $1.5 billion to cash. Investing activities used $10.2 billion, due in large part to purchasing more securities than it sold. Financing activities added $7.5 billion to the coffers mainly by attracting $6.7 billion in client deposits and selling $500 million in preferred stock.</p>
                        <strong>Strategy</strong>
                        <p>Northern Trust?s strategy involves riding growth waves in private wealth management and institutional asset management, both of which are predicted to have (on average) 8.5% compounded annual growth. It is firmly entrenched in these markets and need only to continue what it has been doing to expand its business, both by attracting additional clients in existing markets and by serving greater needs for its existing clients. The company is also addressing the risks associated with data security and the opportunities enabled through artificial intelligence and data analytics. Of the company?s $473 million in 2016 capital expenditures, $430 million went to computer software and hardware, including for the build-out of its new mobile application for its wealth management clients. Northern Trust continued to expand, slowly and methodically, its geographic footprint across the world. Although still a very small amount of its revenue, non-US operations allow the firm to project a global presence for families, firms, and institutions, who themselves are global in nature and seek investment management firms that can meet their international needs. In 2015 it established a team in Melbourne, Australia to provide its asset management products and services to institutional investors across Australia and New Zealand. Also in 2015, to support its Asia Pacific growth strategy and its "local business" strategy to support clients as close to their local markets as possible, Northern Trust opened its Seoul representative office in fast-growing South Korea.</p>

The Company's solutions include technologies, systems, products,services, software, and financing. IBM offers its products through its global sales and distribution organization, as well as through a variety of third party distributors and resellers.</p>
                        <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
                        <p>International Business Machines (IBM) bets that cognition is the ignition for growth. The company is investing in its cognitive computing systems, led by the Watson artificial intelligence platform, that help customers in a wide range of businesses analyze massive amounts of data to make better decisions. Among other areas the company is betting on for growth are security, cloud, and blockchain. The company's information technology, business services, and software units are among the largest in the world. While IBM has placed less emphasis on hardware, the company maintains enterprise server and data storage product lines that are among industry leaders. As the perennial leader in the number of US patents granted, IBM has plenty of ideas in the pipeline.</p>
                        <strong>Operations</strong>
                        <p>IBM manages its sprawling operations in five segments. Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, which generates about 45% of revenue, provides a portfolio of cloud, outsourcing, and other managed services focused on clients? enterprise IT infrastructure. Offerings include maintenance for IBM products and other technology platforms, as well as support.</p>
                        <p>Cognitive Solutions, which provides about a quarter of revenue, includes Watson, IBM?s cognitive computing project. Major Watson initiatives are Watson Platform, Watson Health, and Watson Internet of Things. Another part of the unit is the company?s security platform, which provides detection and protection against cyber threats across a customer?s operations. Global Business Services, about 20% of revenue, provides consulting, application management services, and global process services to help customers move their businesses to digital platforms. Systems, about 10% of revenue, is IBM?s hardware business. It provides technologies for hybrid cloud and cognitive workloads. The unit sells servers, storage systems, and operating systems software.
                        </p>
                        <p>Global Financing provides credit arrangements for customers to buy IBM products. It accounts for about 2% of revenue.</p>
                        <strong>Geographic Reach</strong>
                        <p>The international in IBM has become increasingly important to its bottom line. With clients in about 175 countries, sales outside the US account for more than 50% of revenue. Customers in Europe, theMiddle East, and Africa (EMEA) generate about 30% of sales and Asia/Pacific, about 20%.</p>
                        <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>
                        <p>IBM operates country-based units where consultants, product specialists, and other workers (most hired locally), facilitate the adoption and fulfillment of its products and services. It serves clients across most industries; leading industry groups include financial services, industrial, and communications.
                        </p>
                        <p>Over the past five years, IBM has lost about $20 billion in revenue as it tries to reposition itself to capitalize on cognitive computing, data, analytics, and cloud computing. So far, sales declines tied to older products have outpaced sales of its newer offerings.</p>
                        <p>Revenue slipped about 1% to $79.2 billion in 2017 from 2016. Sales were about 2% higher in Cognitive Solutions from offerings in security, industry platforms, and Watson offerings. The company reported double-digit growth for its Watson Health products. Systems sales rose about 6%, driven by strong response to its z14 mainframe. In terms of dollars, the small Systems segment ($8 billion in revenue) added some $480 million in revenue while Cognitive Solutions ($16 billion in revenue) added about $266 million.</p>
                        <p>Sales from Technology Services & Cloud Platforms dropped about 3% with declines throughout the segment. IBM, however, reported that within the segment the cloud, analytics, mobile, and security elements grew. In Global Business Services growth in strategic initiatives was offset by declines in large ERP and on-premise enterprise application implementation.</p>
                        <p>IBM?s profit dropped by half to about $5.7 billion in 2017 from 2016. The biggest difference was a one-time tax bill of about $5.5 billion because of changes in US tax laws enacted in late 2017. The company had about $12 billion in cash in 2017, compared to about $7.8 billion in 2016. The Company company banked more cash from favorable exchange rates and spent less on acquisitions in 2017.</p>
                        <strong>Strategy</strong>
                        <p>IBM halted its string of quarterly revenue declines at 22 quarters in the fourth quarter of 2017 when sales rose almost 4% from the same quarter in 2016. For the year, IBM?s revenue was down about 1.5%, the sixth straight year of lower annual revenue. Did the 2017 fourth quarter signal a turnaround? IBM thinks indicators are pointing in the right direction and that its investments in cognitive computing, cloud, security, big data, and analytics are beginning to pay off. Together, these helped IBM?s Cognitive Solutions business generate more than $18 billion in revenue in 2017. The company highlighted a 24% increase in cloud revenue to $17 billion. Contributions from the Watson platform including its health initiative boosted Cognitive Solutions revenue to about $18 billion. The company continues to invest in those areas and in emerging technologies such as blockchain, as well as technologies in research stages such as quantum computing. In cloud computing, the company is competing with Amazon, Google (a unit of Alphabet), and Microsoft in offering cloud-based computing infrastructure services. The company focuses on hybrid cloud, the mixture of keeping data on IBM computers and the customer's own systems. Other areas IBM has identified are security and mobility. In 2017, the company introduced a Z series mainframe with encryption capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In addition, IBM is focused on emerging markets where the populations and companies that serve them are embracing mobile, social, cloud, and big data at faster rates, in some cases, than mature countries.</p>

                        <p>The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a bank holding company, is a global investment banking and securities firm specializing in investment banking, trading and principal investments, asset management and securities services. The Company provides services to corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high-net worth individuals.</p>
                        <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
                        <p>Goldman Sachs has long possessed the Midas touch in the investment banking world. A global leader in mergers and acquisitions advice and securities underwriting, Goldman offers a gamut of investment banking and asset management services to corporate and government clients worldwide, as well as institutional and wealth individual investors. It owns Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, one of the largest market makers on the NYSE & and a leading market maker for fixed income products, currencies, and commodities. Through affiliates, Goldman Sachs is also one of the largest private equity investors in the world. Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869.</p>
                        <strong>Operations</strong>
                        <p>Goldman Sachs divides its business into four segments: Institutional Client Services; Investment Banking; Investment Management; and Investing and Lending.</p>
                        <p>Institutional Client Services (ICS) is the firm's largest business and accounts for over 45% of revenue. ICS caters to clients who engage Goldman to buy and sell financial products, raise money, and manage risk. ICS makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency, and commodity products.</p>
                        <p>Investment Banking (over 20% of revenue) activities include financial advisory services and equity and debt underwriting, while Investment Management (some 20% of revenue) provides investment and wealth advisory services to clients, including institutions and wealthy individuals. Goldman's Investing and Lending business (around 15% of revenue) invests directly in publicly and privately traded securities and in loans, and through certain investment funds.</p>
                        <strong>Geographic Reach</strong>
                        <p>New York-based Goldman Sachs has offices in more than 30 countries worldwide. Global locations include Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and the UK. The company generates some 50% of its revenue in the Americas, while over 25% comes from the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region. Another 15% of revenue comes from Asia.</p>
                        <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>
                        <p>The bank serves corporations, financial institutions, governments, and individuals.</p>
                        <strong>Financial Performance</strong>
                        <p>Goldman Sachs has struggled to grow its annual revenues and profits in recent years as gains in its investment banking, investment management, and marketing making businesses have been offset by declining interest income due to shrinking interest margins in the general low-interest environment. For reference, the company's revenue today is far below the $88 billion the firm generated in 2007 (Goldman's heyday prior to the world financial crisis).</p>
                        <p>Goldman Sachs' revenue fell 9% to $30.6 billion during 2016 on the back of a sharp fall in Investment & Lending revenue and weakness in Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, and Investment Management. The best performing segment was Market making, which grew its revenue by $410 million. Interest revenue increased due to higher interest rates and higher total average balances; however interest expense increased at a faster rate due to higher interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities, to a net negative effect.</p>
                        <p>Net income rose 22% to $7.4 billion, partly due to hefty mortgage-related litigation and regulatory- related fees incurred in the previous year, but also due to a $266 million benefit relating to the exchange of APEX for shares during 2016. Cash from operating activities fell 29% to $5.6 billion due to an decrease in financial instruments owned.</p>
                        <strong>Strategy</strong>
                        <p>While Goldman Sachs had become the poster child (or scapegoat) for the excesses of Wall Street, the firm's distinct business culture and prestige continues to attract the investment banking industry's top talent. Teamwork is emphasized, along with an attitude that the firm is the best at what it does. As Goldman Sachs' perennial rank among the top firms in its industry attests, some of the world's foremost companies entrust the firm with their financial and advisory needs.</p>
                        <p>Chipping away at its alleged financial crisis-related mistakes, Goldman Sachs in late 2014 reached an agreement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to resolve all state and federal lawsuits related to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased between 2005 and 2007. Under the agreement, Goldman would repurchase the RBMS for $3.15 billion, which were covered by the company's reserves.</p>
                        <p>India is emerging as a key market for Goldman. The company, via its private equity business, has earmarked up to $1 billion for investment in India over the next four years. Goldman?s approach is to provide cash and entrepreneurial ability to get small businesses off the ground. Companies include ReNew and BPL Medical Technologies.</p>

                        <p>Citigroup Inc. is a diversified financial services holding company that provides a broad range of financial services to consumer and corporate customers. The Company services include investment banking, retail brokerage, corporate banking, and cash management products and services. Citigroup serves customers globally.</p>
                        <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
                        <p>This is the Citi that never sleeps. One of the largest financial services firms known to man, Citigroup (also known as Citi) has some 200 million customer accounts and serves clients around the globe. It offers deposits and loans (mainly through Citibank), investment banking, brokerage, wealth management, and other financial services. Few other banks can equal Citigroup's global reach: In addition to Citibank, it owns stakes in several international regional banks and has more than 130 million Citi-branded credit cards in circulation. Hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis, Citi has been refocusing on its original mission -- traditional banking.Citi has some $1.7 trillion in assets and some $930 billion in deposits.</p>
                        <strong>Operations</strong>
                        <p>Citigroup comprises two segments: Global Consumer Banking (GCB), Institutional Clients Group (ICG). A legacy third segment, Citi Holdings, which was created in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis to contain Citi's loss-making assets, was discontinued as a standalone segment in 2017.</p>
                        <p>The GCB division offers retail bank, credit card, and investment services through subsidiaries including Citibank, Citigroup Global Markets, and Citigroup Private Bank. The ICG division is made up of banking and markets securities services businesses and serves corporate, institutional, public sector, and high-net-worth clients. Citi makes about 70% of its revenue from interest.</p>
                        <p>The Citi Holdings division, which is being wound down and does not perform a business function, contains underperforming operations and assets that Citigroup plans to shed entirely, including struggling consumer finance segments such as CitiMortgage and brokerage and asset management divisions.</p>
                        <strong>Geographic Reach </strong>
                        <p>Citigroup conducts operations in more than 160 countries and territories. It has some nearly 2,650 branch locations, and issues Citi credit cards in Africa, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia/Pacific region. About 45% of the group's revenue comes from North America, while Asia contributes around 20%. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) and Latin America made up another 15% each.</p>
                        <strong>Financial Performance</strong>
                        <p>Citigroup's revenue and profits have been trending downward over the past several years. To stabilize its finances, the group has been unloading its toxic holdings and reducing non-core holdings while investing in its core banking businesses.</p>
                        <p>The bank's revenue dipped by 7% to $83.3 billion in fiscal 2016, mostly due to the impact of the current low-interest environment on loan interest income; exchange rate fluctuations also had a negative impact. Mortgage revenue was particularly badly hit, albeit offset by growth in average loans and checking deposits. Citi-branded card revenue was up 5% to $8.2 billion, boosted by the acquisition of American Express' Costco card portfolio. Revenue in the Institutional Clients Group segment were essentially flat in 2016 as a 5% decrease in banking revenue offset a 4% increase in markets and securities services.</p>
                        <strong>Strategy</strong>
                        <p>Most of Citigroup's efforts in recent years have focused on downsizing, cutting costs, and repaying debt through asset sales and other restructuring measures. To optimize its branch footprint and concentrate its presence in major metropolitan markets, Citigroup plans to sell or shrink certain consumer banking operations in non-core markets. It plans to sell its Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia retail businesses due to declines in Latin America. The units, part of the company for over 100 years, have been moved into Citi Holdings, its outhouse for unwanted assets. Citigroup has also continued to make great progress in winding down its Citi Holdings operations.Once sporting $600 billion in assets, Citi reduced Citi Holdings' asset values to less than $54 billion by early 2017, to the extent that it is no longer deemed a standalone reportable segment.It's not all cutting, withdrawing and downsizing, however. The company's Global Consumer Bank partnered with Visa in 2016 to issue co-branded credit cards available to Costco's 50 million members, taking over from American Express. It has also teamed up with leading lights in smartphone payment technology, including Android Pay (Google), Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay to make mobile handset payments available to US customers. It also teamed up with MasterCard to offer the Citi MasterPass digital wallet.</p>

                        <p>Johnson & Johnson manufactures health care products and provides related services for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets. The Company sells products such as skin and hair care products, acetaminophen products, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic equipment, and surgical equipment in countries located around the world.</p>
                        <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
                        <p>It's difficult to get well without Johnson & Johnson (J&J). The diversified health care giant operates in three segments through more than 250 operating companies located in some 60 countries. Its Medical Devices division offers surgical equipment, monitoring devices, orthopedic and insulin delivery products, and contact lenses, among other things. J&J's Pharmaceuticals division makes drugs for an array of ailments, such as neurological conditions, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases, and pain. Top sellers are psoriasis drug Remicade and cancer medication Velcade. Finally, J&J's Consumer business makes over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and products for baby, skin, and oral care, as well as first-aid and nutritional uses.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Operations</strong>
                        <p>J&J prides itself on its decentralized operating structure, with the management teams of its myriad and far-flung operating units having wide latitude to make decisions. Each company belongsto one of J&J's three broad divisions: The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices segments account for about 45% and 35% of sales, respectively, while the Consumer division contributes about 20% of annual revenues. J&J's diversified business model also allows for some insulation against troubles in any one market. </p>
                        <p>In its Medical Devices division, many operating companies -- including surgical supplies companies Ethicon and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, orthopedics device maker DePuy, and vision care subsidiary Vision Care-- have experienced strong sales growth. The division also includes the LifeScan diabetes care unit. </p>
                        <p>Operating companies in the Pharmaceuticals division include Janssen Biotech and Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Remicade is the company's top earner, bringing in about $7 billion in annual sales or some 10% of total revenue; in addition to psoriasis, the drug treats Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. In addition, key drugs earning over $1 billion annually are Procrit (sold internationally as Eprex), schizophrenia medication Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza, cancer treatment Velcade, AIDS therapy Prezista, and plaque psoriasis drug Stelara. The Consumer segment sells products including J&J's baby products, the Listerine brand of oral care products, and skin care brands including Aveeno, Clean & Clear, and Neutrogena.</p>
                        <strong>Geographic Reach</strong>
                        <p>J&J has more than 250 operating companies in 60 countries selling products around the world.It in North America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. While the US and Europe represent the company's largest markets (accounting for more than 50% and about 25% of sales, respectively), the firm has been working to expand its presence in markets in Asia (especially China) and other regions that are emerging as high-growth opportunities. The Asia/Pacific region and Africa together account for more than 15% of revenue, while the non-US Western Hemisphere accounts for about 10%. </p>
                        <strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>
                        <p>J&J distributes its products to retailers, wholesalers, and health care providers including hospitals.Medical devices are marketed to the orthopedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care, and vision care industries. They are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers. The company spent $2.4 billion on advertising campaigns (including television, radio, print, and online ads) in fiscal 2017; this was down from $2.5 spent in 2015 and $2.6 billion spent in 2014.</p>
                        <strong>Financial Performance</strong>
                        <p>J&J had seen steady revenue growth over the past few years, but in fiscal 2016 (ended January) revenue dropped 6% to $70.1 billion. It recovered 3% to $71.9 billion in fiscal 2017. This was due to a 6% increase in pharmaceuticals sales, but was partially offset by declines in medical device and consumer product sales. In pharmaceuticals, strong performers included Remicade (despite competition from biosimilar versions of the drug), Simponi, Stelara, Imbruvica, and Edurant. Net income has followed revenue's suit, rising until 2016 when it fell 6% to $15.4 billion. In 2017 it rose 7%$16.5 billion.</p>
                        <strong>Strategy</strong>
                        <p>J&J's core strategies for growth are to create value through innovation, expand its international reach, execute with excellence, and lead with purpose. It has worked toward these goals through such efforts as embracing health care technology, acquiring new businesses (such as Abbott Medical Optics, purchased in early 2017), and strategically divesting certain units. In the pharmaceuticals business, J&J is focused on innovating in therapeutic areas where the medical needs are largely unmet. It spends some $5.4 billion on its R&D pipeline annually, seeking new treatments as well as new indications for existing products. The company hopes to launch 10 blockbusters, or products that will top $1 billion in annual sales, by 2019. It also fights to keep its drugs competitive by protecting its patents against the releases of biosimilars. J&J also plans to launch innovative products through its consumer and medical device segments. It has expanded those segments through recent acquisitions, and it is improving margins by utilizing supply chain and operational efficiencies.</p>
